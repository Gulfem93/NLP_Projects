       "\"Even an EV needs service from time to time. Kia Marin hits the ball out of the park each time I've needed assistance or service. I purchased my Kia Niro EV in 2019 and couldn't be happier. Matthew, Eddie and the entire team are efficient, knowledgeable, fully up to speed on Kia vehicle services and explain services and pricing so you know what you are getting is what your car needs at a reasonable price. I  know I will get excellent service and a pleasant welcome each time I call or come by in person. I am very happy with my vehicle and its care. This uncomplicates at least one important job in daily life - having safe, reliable and well maintained transportation. Would that Kia could branch out to other endeavors to help our lives flow smoothly. Go with Kia. No wonder it gets high  marks in national vehicle reviews! Not just the product is the end of the line. It's a well build service organization that cares about keeping customers.\""
